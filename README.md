# Prepr-Internship-Challenge

Welcome to the ReadMe file of this project. 
The key changes I made with the layout of Home page is the menu that pops out when you press the sandwich button has been moved to the 
top right of the pate under account. It can be accessed by hovering over the account icon. That way we have all the settings under one 
place.

The second change I made is replacing the challenge div's with cards that display the necessary information on hover. By doing this I was
able to display more cards that is more challenges per screen compared to the old layout. Meaning more challenges are visible compared to the old layout.

I also changed the main options tab i.e. Labs, Challenges, Projects tab. I made it more minimal and simply animated and more visible by making it a centralized selection menu right underneath the navbar.


I also added animation to the cards so on page load they will zoom-in and appear one by one using AOS.js library.
